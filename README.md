CI/CD Pipeline on AWS (GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeDeploy → EC2)

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS services. The pipeline automatically deploys a web application to an Amazon EC2 instance whenever changes are pushed to a GitHub repository.
The goal was to eliminate manual deployments and implement an automated, production-style workflow.
